        <td>Question: I tried making one of your recipes and it didn’t turn out very well. What can I do next time get it to turn out right?</td>
        <td>Since I was there when you tried making it, it is very difficult to pinpoint the exact thing that went wrong. Having said that, if a recipe doesn’t turn out the first time, there are a few things you can do next time:

<p>1) Reread the list of ingredients, the amounts for each, and the directions to make sure you haven’t skipped anything.</p>
<p>2) Make sure that you made no substitutions on the first try.</p>
<p>3) Look up the post again and read the comments and any tips involving that recipe.</p>
<p>4) If you still haven’t uncovered what went wrong, please leave a comment for us directly on that recipe. We will try and figure out why it didn’t work for you. Posting right on the recipe encourages others to provide feedback and perhaps offer suggestions.</p></td>

        <td>Question: Would this recipe work if I used [substitute ingredient] instead of [ingredient in recipe]?</td>
        <td>The recipes we’ve provided have only been made with the ingredients listed. However, there may be a lot of different ingredients that you can substitute in that will work just as well. But without trying it that way ourselves there is no way we could be sure. We recommend that you try the recipe first as written and then next time you can try adding your own twist.</td>

        <td>Question: Can you share the nutritional information for this recipe?</td>
        <td>Unfortunately, as I am not a registered dietician, I am not comfortable sharing nutritional information for any of my recipes. I recommend utilizing online calorie counters at your discretion to obtain such information.</td>
