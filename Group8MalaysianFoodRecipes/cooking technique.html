<h2>BOILING</h2>
<img src="boiling.jpg" alt="Boiling">
<p>A fundamental cooking method, boiling allows you to create a wide range of dishes with varying textures and tastes.</p>
<p>Tip: After removing vegetables or pasta from boiling water, soak them in cold water to stop the cooking process so they don’t become overcooked and bland.</p>

<h2>DEEP FRYING</h2>
<img src="deepfring.jpg" alt="deepfrying">
<p>Sharing many of the same characteristics as pan-fried food, deep frying completely submerges food in oil to achieve a textured crust and savoury interior. To ensure even cooking, trim and cut your ingredients uniformly.</p>
<p>Tip: Always season before coating your food and experiment with different batters to achieve new textures.</p>

<h2>STEAMING</h2>
<img src="steaming.jpg" alt="steaming">
<p>Steaming is ideal for cooking up dishes that are plump and tender. Steaming also helps to retain the original moisture in the food. The closed cooking vessel and hot water vapour provide an even, moist environment to cook food in.</p>
<p>Tip: For additional flavour, replace some (or all) of the water with a broth, stock or fruit juice. Bear in mind that steamed dishes taste best when served hot, so don’t compromise on this.</p>

<div class="box">
<h2>PAN FRYING</h2>
<img src="pan-frying.jpg" alt="pan-frying">
<p>Characterised by letting the hot oil lock natural juices inside the meat, pan-fried foods have a richly-textured crust and a moist, savoury interior.</p>
<p>Tip: For more flavour, use herbs or dried spices in your batter or season before pan-frying.</p>
